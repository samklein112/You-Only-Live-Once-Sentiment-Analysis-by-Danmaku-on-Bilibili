The story follows Du Leying, a chronically unemployed woman in her 30s who lives with her family and struggles with depression and self-esteem issues. After a series of personal setbacks, including a painful breakup and a failed appearance on a reality TV show, Leying decides to take control of her life by taking up boxing. She trains rigorously, loses significant weight, and ultimately participates in a boxing match that, despite her loss, earns her respect and a newfound sense of self-worth.

The movie highlights themes of personal transformation, perseverance, and the struggle for self-respect. It also explores family dynamics and societal pressures. The film was well-received, grossing significant box office revenue and becoming a notable release during the Lunar New Year holiday season.

## Rationales
“You Only Live Once” (YOLO) was chosen due to its remarkable popularity and the diverse range of public reactions it garnered both before and after its release. Its box office success, grossing over 3.2 billion yuan within the first 15 days of release, underscores its impact and reach among audiences. 

More importantly, critics and audiences had mixed reactions; some praised the film for its inspirational message and Jia Ling’s performance, while others criticized it for perceived gimmicks related to weight loss. The diverse opinions make it a compelling subject for sentiment analysis, reflecting a broad spectrum of public sentiment and discussion.

Bilibili, a leading video-sharing platform in China, offers high objectivity and reliability for collecting audience feedback, especially since the original movie was released officially on the platform. This ensures that the comments and interactions are directly related to the genuine viewing experience. Additionally, Bilibili’s danmaku feature allows viewers to post real-time comments while watching the film, providing a unique and immediate reflection of their emotions and thoughts. 

This real-time interaction is invaluable for sentiment analysis as it captures spontaneous reactions, enhancing the authenticity and depth of the analysis. Studies have shown that danmaku can effectively convey audience instant sentiment and engagement, making it a powerful tool for understanding viewer responses.
